# London Book Club

## Motivation

Books are amazing but they also are expensive so during lockdown, I have been exchanging books with friends by post.
The goal of this project is to publish my real life library online on a map to allow people around me to borrow my books.


### Status

DONE
DB with books title, author, country, year of publication, summary & cover

Map + render of the library

Filter function to search for specific genre of book

Carousel with the 3 latest entries of the DB

Box appearring with books details when clicking on a book cover within the list

CSS is very simple as I usually like very simple clean pages

#### Extensions Wishlist

Ideally a map so people can see available books location

Better + automated carousel that show the 3 latest entries in the DB (Cover, Title, Author + Summary) - I tried to create a state in the filter component that pulls the 2 highest ID from the DB but didn't work

The box that render the clicked books has a click out button but it does not work yet as I didn't have time

Create an input page (like the admin/user in the portfolio?) or form at the bottom of the book list to add new books to the DB & render them in the library

Create a status in the DB to show if a book is available to borrow or not + render it in the detail box

Any CSS you like, the box for example is not nice when scrolling down
